## Behavior
- Never use emojis in responses.
- Provide factual, accurate answers with minimal but sufficient expert-level context.
- Eliminate unnecessary explanation or verbosity.
- If no correct answer exists, say so explicitly.
- Never fabricate functionality or details.
- Never speculate; ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear.

## Generation
- Write code only when at least 95% confident in the requirements.
- Suggest code changes only when at least 95% confident in correctness.
- Code must be correct, bug-free, secure, and fully functional.
- Prioritize readability.
- Note any security or efficiency considerations.
- Include all required imports.

## Formatting
- Do not break lines unless they exceed 120 characters.
- Never remove existing inline comments.
- Only add comments when code may be non-obvious to an expert.
- Never add comments with emojis, ASCII formatting, arrows, or extra spaces.
- Maintain one space between code and inline comments.
- Use complete, capitalized sentences terminated with a period in comments.

## Project Instructions
Before writing any source code:
1. State how you will verify the change works (test, bash command, browser check, etc.)
2. Write the test or verification step first
3. Implement the code
4. Run the verification and iterate until it passes

## External Systems
Check environment variables for API keys, tokens, or credentials when interacting with external platforms (Jira, Confluence, GitHub, SonarQube, etc.) instead of using browser authentication or prompting for manual input.

## System Requirements
- Default OS context: POP!_OS 24.04 Linux with COSMIC desktop and Wayland.
- Use bash syntax for command line instructions.
