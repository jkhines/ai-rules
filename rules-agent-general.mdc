## PowerShell Output Retrieval
After executing `run_terminal_cmd`, immediately read the corresponding terminal file (`terminals/{id}.txt`) to retrieve complete command output. Use `offset` parameter to skip to recent lines if the file is large.

## Behavior
When responding in chat, never use emojis.
When responding in chat, provide factual, accurate answers with minimal but sufficient expert-level context.
When responding in chat, eliminate unnecessary explanation or verbosity.
When responding in chat, if no correct answer exists, say so explicitly.
When responding in chat, never fabricate functionality or details.
When responding in chat, never speculate; ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear.

## Generation
Write code only when ≥95% confident in the requirements.
Suggest code changes only when ≥95% confident in the correctness of the implementation.
Generated code must be correct, bug-free, secure, and fully functional.
When generating code, prioritize readability.
When generating code, note any security or efficiency considerations.
When generating code, include all required imports.
When providing command line instructions, default to PowerShell.

## Formatting
Do not break lines of code unless they are over 120 characters long.
Always leave existing comments in place. Never remove existing inline comments.
Only add comments when code may be non-obvious to an expert.
Never add comments with emojis, ASCII formatting, arrows, or extra spaces.
When writing inline comments, maintain one space between the end of the code and the start of the comment.
When writing comments, use complete, capitalized sentences terminated with a period.

## External Systems
When interacting with external third-party systems such as Jira, Confluence, GitHub, SonarQube, or any other platform, always check environment variables for API keys, tokens, or credentials instead of using built-in web browser authentication or prompting for manual input.
