CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under CC0, thereby dedicating the Work to
the public domain.

Affirmer's Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT
   POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS
   OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
   STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE
   ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
   ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
   EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU
   ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR
   OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
   PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING
   OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS
   BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
   DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART,
   THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above
   shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most
   closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 1 -- Definitions

a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
   pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
   arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,
   or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
   other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
   including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a
   work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
   the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a
   musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
   timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
   Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
   encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,
   or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)
   below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
   constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
   entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
   each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which
   together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
   Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the
   purposes of this License.

c. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed at
   https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been approved by
   Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this License, including,
   at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains terms that have the same
   purpose, meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
   (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works made
   available under that license under this License or a Creative Commons
   jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this License.

d. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
   of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer
   of ownership.

e. "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes as
   selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:

f. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that

g. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
   who created the Work.

h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
   of this License including without limitation any production in the
   literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form
   of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and
   other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature;
   a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment
   in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic
   work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
   cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
   engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated
   works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
   art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative
   to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a
   broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected
   as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer
   to the extent it is not a work considered a literary or artistic work.

i. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License
   who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to
   the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to
   exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.

j. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
   communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
   process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
   performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
   members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
   individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means
   or process and to communicate to the public these performances, including by
   public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
   means including signs, sounds or images.

Section 2 -- Scope

a. License grant.

   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
      protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
      Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
      limited to, the following:

      i. the right to reproduce, Adapt, Distribute, Perform, Sublicense, and
         publicly display the Work;

     ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
         likeness depicted in a Work;

     iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
         subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
         in a Work;

     vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
         European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 1996 on the
         legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation
         thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
         directive); and

    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
         world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
         implementation thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
   of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
   irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
   Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
   of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
   future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
   worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
   treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
   medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
   including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
   purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of
   each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's
   heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
   subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any
   other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
   by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
   be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
   Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
   account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
   extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
   person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non
   exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's
   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories
   worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
   treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
   medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
   including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
   purposes. The Waiver shall be effective to the maximum extent permitted
   by law.

      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.

   c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
