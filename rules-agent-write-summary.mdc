Write a single-session conversation summary optimized for future AI agents to continue work with minimal context consumption.

## File Location
- Directory: `context/` (create if it does not exist)
- Filename: `context-<topic>.md` where `<topic>` is inferred from the conversation, lowercase, spaces replaced by dashes
- Example: `context/context-auth-refactor.md`

## Structure

1. **Context**: One-sentence project overview.
2. **Solution Evolution**: Chronological list of approaches tried, including failures and why they failed.
3. **Current Solution**: Final implemented approach with key technical details.
4. **Constraints Discovered**: Critical rules, limitations, or requirements found during implementation.
5. **User Preferences**: Behavioral preferences relevant to future interactions.
6. **Current State**: Status (complete/in-progress), outstanding items, known issues.
7. **Usage**: Commands to run/test the solution.
8. **Key Files**: Files and their purposes (one line each).

## Writing Rules

- Use terse bullet points. No prose paragraphs.
- Reference file paths instead of including code snippets.
- Reference file paths instead of describing data structures.
- Include external integrations (URLs, APIs, credentials location).
- Document error handling approaches that were non-obvious.
- Omit information discoverable by reading the referenced files.
