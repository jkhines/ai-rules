## Instructions
Create a file in the context directory with the following naming convention:
Preface: "context-"
Name: The name of the current chat, lowercase, with spaces replaced by dashes.
Extension: ".md"
If a context directory does not exist, create one.
### Target Audience
- Write for future AI agents who need to continue the work seamlessly
- Optimize for maximum context with minimum length to preserve context buffer space

### Content Guidelines
1. **Include both failed approaches and final working solutions** - document the evolution of the project
2. **Don't include discoverable context** - avoid repeating information that can be found by examining files (like JSON structure, code snippets)
3. **Use pointers for discoverability** - reference files and locations where detailed information can be found
4. **Emphasize key areas**:
   - Solution evolution and approach changes
   - Technical requirements and constraints discovered
   - Current working state and status
   - User preferences and requirements

### Structure Template
1. **Context** - Brief project overview
2. **Evolution of Solutions** - Chronological progression including failed attempts
3. **Current Working Solution** - Final implemented approach with key details
4. **Key Technical Requirements Discovered** - Critical constraints and rules
5. **User Preferences** - Important behavioral preferences for future interactions
6. **Current State** - Project status and outstanding items
7. **Usage** - How to run/use the current solution
8. **Files in Project** - Key files and their purposes

### Style Requirements
- Concise bullet points and short paragraphs
- Technical accuracy without unnecessary detail
- Clear section headers for easy navigation
- Include specific file names and key dependencies
- Document error handling approaches
- Note any external service integrations (URLs, APIs, etc.)

### What NOT to Include
- Full code snippets (reference files instead)
- Detailed data structures (point to example files)
- Step-by-step procedures (link to working scripts)
- Verbose explanations (prioritize brevity)

The goal is to enable a new AI agent to quickly understand the project state, failed approaches, current solution, and user preferences without consuming excessive context space.
