command: /force-push
description: Temporarily bypass organization and repository rules, commit staged changes, push to remote, and restore rules
alwaysApply: false
---

## Purpose
Temporarily disables GitHub organization and repository rulesets for the current repository, commits staged changes using Conventional Commits, pushes to remote, and then re-enables all rules.

## Prerequisites
- User must have GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- User must have access to an account with `admin:org` scope for the organization
- Changes should already be staged or ready to commit

## Execution Steps

When `/force-push` is invoked:

### 1. **Identify Repository Context**
   - Run `git remote get-url origin` to get the repository URL
   - Extract organization name and repository name from the URL
     - Format: `https://github.com/{org}/{repo}.git`
   - Run `git branch --show-current` to get the current branch name
   - Run `git status` to verify there are changes to commit

### 2. **Authenticate with Admin Permissions**
   - Run `gh auth status` to check current authentication
   - Look for an account with `admin:org` scope in the token scopes
   - If the active account doesn't have `admin:org`:
     - Identify which account has `admin:org` scope
     - Run `gh auth switch -u {account-with-admin-org}`
     - Store the original account name to switch back later

### 3. **Retrieve Organization Rulesets**
   - Run `gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets --jq '.[] | select(.target == "branch") | {id, name, enforcement}'`
   - Identify rulesets that apply to branches (typically named like "pr_required_rule" or similar)
   - For each ruleset found:
     - Store the ruleset ID
     - Check if it affects the current repository

### 4. **Disable Organization Rules for This Repository**
   For each applicable organization ruleset:
   - Run:
     ```powershell
     gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} | ConvertFrom-Json | ForEach-Object { $_.conditions.repository_name.exclude += "{repo}"; $_ } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File -FilePath update-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json -Encoding utf8
     ```
   - Apply the update:
     ```powershell
     gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} -X PUT --input update-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json
     ```
   - Verify success by checking the exclude list:
     ```powershell
     gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} --jq '.conditions.repository_name.exclude'
     ```
   - Clean up: `Remove-Item update-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json`

### 5. **Retrieve and Disable Repository-Level Rulesets**
   Repository-level rulesets (such as required status checks) must also be disabled:
   - Run `gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/rulesets --jq '.[] | {id, name, enforcement}'`
   - For each ruleset with `enforcement: "active"`:
     - Store the ruleset ID and original enforcement state
     - Disable by changing enforcement to `disabled`:
       ```powershell
       gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} | ConvertFrom-Json | ForEach-Object { $_.enforcement = "disabled"; $_ } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File -FilePath update-repo-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json -Encoding utf8
       ```
     - Apply the update:
       ```powershell
       gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} -X PUT --input update-repo-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json
       ```
     - Verify enforcement is now `disabled`:
       ```powershell
       gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} --jq '.enforcement'
       ```
     - Clean up: `Remove-Item update-repo-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json`

### 6. **Commit Changes Using Conventional Commits**
   - Execute the `/commit-code` command workflow
   - This command will:
     - Check git status and identify changes
     - Validate the current branch name against conventional naming standards
     - Offer to create a proper branch if needed
     - Analyze changes and determine appropriate commit type
     - Generate a Conventional Commit message
     - Stage changes if needed
     - Execute the commit and display confirmation
   - **Important**: Skip the branch validation step in `/commit-code` if the current branch is `main`, `master`, or `develop` since force-pushing to these branches is the intended use case
   - Capture the commit hash for the summary report

### 7. **Push to Remote**
   - Run `git push origin {current-branch}`
   - Verify push was successful
   - Display confirmation with commit details

### 8. **Re-enable Organization Rules**
   For each organization ruleset that was modified:
   - Remove the repository from the exclude list. **Important**: Always use explicit empty array `@()` to avoid invalid JSON when filtering produces null:
     ```powershell
     gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} | ConvertFrom-Json | ForEach-Object { $_.conditions.repository_name.exclude = @(); $_ } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File -FilePath restore-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json -Encoding utf8
     ```
   - If there were other repositories in the exclude list that should remain, use filtering instead:
     ```powershell
     gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} | ConvertFrom-Json | ForEach-Object { $_.conditions.repository_name.exclude = @($_.conditions.repository_name.exclude | Where-Object { $_ -ne "{repo}" }); $_ } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File -FilePath restore-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json -Encoding utf8
     ```
   - Apply the restore:
     ```powershell
     gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} -X PUT --input restore-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json
     ```
   - Verify restoration:
     ```powershell
     gh api orgs/{org}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} --jq '.conditions.repository_name.exclude'
     ```
   - Clean up: `Remove-Item restore-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json`

### 9. **Re-enable Repository-Level Rulesets**
   For each repository ruleset that was disabled in step 5:
   - Restore enforcement to `active`:
     ```powershell
     gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} | ConvertFrom-Json | ForEach-Object { $_.enforcement = "active"; $_ } | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10 | Out-File -FilePath restore-repo-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json -Encoding utf8
     ```
   - Apply the restore:
     ```powershell
     gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} -X PUT --input restore-repo-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json
     ```
   - Verify enforcement is restored:
     ```powershell
     gh api repos/{org}/{repo}/rulesets/{ruleset-id} --jq '.enforcement'
     ```
   - Clean up: `Remove-Item restore-repo-ruleset-{ruleset-id}.json`

### 10. **Restore Original GitHub Account**
   - If the account was switched in step 2:
     - Run `gh auth switch -u {original-account}`

### 11. **Summary Report**
   Display a summary:
   ```
   ✓ Organization rules temporarily bypassed
   ✓ Repository rules temporarily bypassed
   ✓ Changes committed: {commit-hash} - {commit-message}
   ✓ Pushed to {remote}/{branch}
   ✓ Organization rules restored
   ✓ Repository rules restored
   ✓ GitHub account restored to {original-account}
   ```

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- If no account has `admin:org` scope:
  - Display message: "No GitHub account with 'admin:org' scope found. Run: gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:org"
  - Exit without making changes

### Ruleset API Errors
- If 404 errors occur when accessing rulesets:
  - Check if authentication has proper scopes
  - Verify organization name is correct
  - Display helpful error message with actual API response
- If 422 errors occur when restoring rulesets:
  - This typically indicates invalid JSON structure (e.g., null array from filtering)
  - Use explicit empty array `@()` instead of filtering when the exclude list would become empty

### Push Failures
- If push fails even after disabling organization rules:
  - Check for repository-level rulesets that may also be blocking the push
  - Common blockers include required status checks (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, code analysis)
  - Disable repository rulesets as described in step 5
  - Retry the push after disabling all applicable rulesets
  - Do NOT restore rules until push succeeds or user confirms abort

### Partial Completion
- If any step fails after rules are disabled:
  - Attempt to restore all rules (both organization and repository) before exiting
  - Clearly indicate which steps completed and which failed
  - Provide manual restoration commands if automatic restore fails

## Notes
- This command is designed for PowerShell on Windows
- Requires organization administrator privileges for organization rulesets
- Requires repository admin privileges for repository-level rulesets
- Always restores all rules (organization and repository) even if push fails
- Maintains audit trail of all GitHub API operations
- Organization rulesets use exclude lists; repository rulesets use enforcement toggling
- When restoring exclude lists, always wrap filtered results in `@()` to ensure valid array structure
- Common repository-level blockers include required status checks for CI/CD pipelines and code analysis tools
